# About Me

Hello! I'm Krishna Teja Vedula, a PhD candidate in Astrophysics at Michigan Technlogical University.

My research focuses on studying Blazars. I also have a Master's degree in Mechanical Enginnering from University of Houston. Being a student of both enginnering and physics I always thought I had an interesting view of both fields. This also helped me gain a wide variety of skills that I hope to share with everyone.

Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to discuss any material that is presented in these tutorials!

Thank you for visiting my page!
