title: 6.1 Introduction to Remote Repositories
---


While Git runs locally, you can connect to an online **remote repository** to back up your work and collaborate with others.

### Git Hosting Platforms

Popular Git hosting platforms include:

* **GitHub** – The most widely used platform for open-source and private repositories.
* **GitLab** – Offers built-in CI/CD pipelines and can be self-hosted.
* **Codeberg** – Community-driven and privacy-friendly.
* **Gitea** – Lightweight, open-source, and easy to self-host.
* **Forgejo** – A community-maintained fork of Gitea.

Choose GitHub or GitLab for cloud collaboration, or Gitea/Forgejo for local, self-hosted development.
