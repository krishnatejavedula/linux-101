---

- **Unix Philosophy:** Do one thing and do it well.
- Combine commands with pipes for efficiency.
- **Get Help:**

  ```bash
  command --help
  man command
  ```

- **Stay Safe:**

  - Double-check before `rm -r`.
  - Use `sudo` sparingly.

- **Update Regularly:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade   # Ubuntu
  sudo dnf upgrade                      # Fedora
  ```
