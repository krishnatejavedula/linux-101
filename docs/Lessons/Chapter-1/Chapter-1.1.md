You'll begin with three mainstream Linux distributions:

* **[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)** – beginner-friendly with excellent WSL integration.
* **[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)** – rock-solid, widely used in servers.
* **[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)** – Stable, user-frendly, cutting-edge.

In this chapter, you'll:

1. Explore options for running Linux on your machine.
2. Install Debian using a live USB.
3. Set up Ubuntu via WSL for Windows users.
4. Use essential package management tools (`apt`, `dnf`).
